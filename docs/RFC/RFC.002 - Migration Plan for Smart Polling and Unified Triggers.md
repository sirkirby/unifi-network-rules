## Objective

Provide a comprehensive migration strategy for users to transition from the legacy trigger system to the new unified `unr_changed` trigger with a clean breaking change approach, including automated migration tooling and clear documentation.

## Current Implementation Status

### âœ… **Phase 1: Foundation (Completed)**

- Smart polling architecture implemented
- Unified change detection system active
- New `unr_changed` trigger available
- Legacy triggers still functional with deprecation warnings
- **Dual trigger emission** - Both legacy AND new triggers fire simultaneously

### ðŸ”„ **Phase 2: Transition Period (Current)**

- Legacy triggers marked as deprecated but fully functional
- New `unr_changed` trigger available for early adopters
- Documentation and migration examples provided
- User education and community engagement

### ðŸ“‹ **Phase 3: Legacy Removal (Future)**

- Timeline: TBD based on adoption metrics
- Complete removal of legacy trigger code
- Performance optimizations post-cleanup

## Migration Strategy

### **Approach: Clean Breaking Change with Migration Tools**

We implement a **clean architectural break** with comprehensive migration support:

1. **Legacy triggers completely removed** - clean codebase
2. **Single `unr_changed` trigger system** - no dual complexity
3. **Automated migration utility** for easy conversion
4. **Comprehensive documentation** with examples
5. **Clear error messages** directing to migration guide

### **Benefits of This Approach**

- âœ… **Clean, maintainable codebase** without legacy burden
- âœ… **Simplified architecture** - no dual system complexity
- âœ… **Better performance** without legacy overhead
- âœ… **Future-proof foundation** for new features
- âœ… **Clear migration path** with automated tooling

automation:
  - alias: "Guest Network Enabled"
    trigger:
      platform: unifi_network_rules
      type: rule_enabled
      rule_type: firewall_policy
      name_filter: "Guest"
    action:
      - service: notify.mobile_app
        data:
          message: "Guest network access enabled"

# After  
automation:
  - alias: "Guest Network Enabled"
    trigger:
      platform: unifi_network_rules
      type: unr_changed
      change_type: firewall_policy
      change_action: enabled
      name_filter: "Guest"
    action:
      - service: notify.mobile_app
        data:
          message: "Guest network access enabled"
```

#### **Complex Multi-Action Triggers**

```yaml
# Before (multiple triggers needed)
automation:
  - alias: "Any Rule Change"

## Conclusion

This migration plan provides a **risk-averse, user-friendly approach** to transitioning from legacy triggers to the unified system. By maintaining full backward compatibility and allowing users to migrate at their own pace, we minimize disruption while enabling the benefits of the new architecture.

The key insight is that **both systems can coexist temporarily**, allowing for gradual migration and real-world validation of the new approach before any breaking changes are introduced.

**Timeline Summary:**

- **Phase 1:** âœ… Complete (Smart polling + unified triggers + backward compatibility)
- **Phase 2:** ðŸ”„ 6-12 months (Education + gradual migration + metrics collection)
- **Phase 3:** ðŸ“‹ TBD (Legacy removal based on success criteria)

This approach ensures a **smooth transition** that respects existing user investments while enabling the long-term benefits of the simplified, unified architecture.
