**Your job: Gather decisions through reasoning. The CLI handles everything else.**

1. **Analyze** - Run `oak constitution analyze --json`
2. **Confirm** - Verify classification with user, gather metadata
3. **Research** - Investigate technologies and patterns (use web if available)
4. **Assess** - Determine which decisions are relevant for this project type
5. **Decide** - Gather user decisions on RELEVANT areas only
6. **Generate** - Run `oak constitution create --json` (creates constitution + agent files + validates)
7. **Report** - Deliver summary and next steps

Focus your effort on reasoning and decision gathering. The CLI handles file creation, agent files, and validation automatically.
