## Workflow Overview

1. **Preflight** - Load constitution, detect version style
2. **Review** - Manual evaluation using structural checklist and quality rubric
3. **Synthesize** - Compile findings, gaps, and opportunities
4. **Cross-check** - Optional CLI validation to corroborate
5. **Fix** - Interactive fixes with justification
6. **Report** - Final health assessment and recommendations

Lead with your own analysis. The CLI validator supports but doesn't replace your judgment.
