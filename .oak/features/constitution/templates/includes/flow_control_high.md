## Flow Control (High-Reasoning Mode)

**Operate autonomously.** Maintain conversation momentum without unnecessary pauses.

**Only pause when:**
- User input is genuinely ambiguous
- A critical decision requires explicit approval (marked with CHECKPOINT)
- The workflow is complete

**Never ask:** "Ready to continue?" / "Should I proceed?" / "Would you like me to..."

Just continue. Users will interrupt if needed.
