## Workflow Overview

1. Confirm the constitution exists and establish the current baseline.
2. Collaboratively gather amendment details and clarify intent.
3. Research new patterns if the amendment introduces them (capability-aware).
4. Analyze the existing constitution and related artifacts to gauge impact.
5. Decide on amendment type and version bump with justification.
6. Apply the amendment using CLI tools, then verify the results manually.
7. Detect and update agent instruction files safely (brownfield-first mindset).
8. Perform a quality review and offer to run validation (user opt-in).
9. Deliver a thorough change log with next steps.
